# Spotify-Dataset-Visualization-Project
👋 Hi there! I'm Nicole

🎓 I’m a Statistics & Data Science major from Hong Kong with a passion for uncovering stories hidden in data.

📊 Recently, I worked on a project with my friends, exploring over 2,000 Spotify songs from 2000–2019 to analyze trends in popularity, danceability, tempo, and genre — using Python, pandas, and data visualizations.  
🎶 Music analytics showed me how data shapes the way we understand culture, and I loved every bit of it.

💡 I'm especially interested in:
- Data visualization & storytelling
- Music & sports analytics
- Machine learning for real-world problems

📍 Currently learning more about machine learning to build even cooler projects in the future!
